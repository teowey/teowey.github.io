<h1>XHTML INTRO</h1>

<p>Extensible Hypertext Markup Language (XHTML) is a family of XML markup languages that mirror or extend versions of the widely used Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), the language in which Web pages are formulated.
While HTML, prior to HTML5, was defined as an application of Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), a flexible markup language framework, XHTML is an application of XML, a more restrictive subset of SGML. XHTML documents are well-formed and may therefore be parsed using standard XML parsers, unlike HTML, which requires a lenient HTML-specific parser.
XHTML 1.0 became a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Recommendation on
January 26, 2000. XHTML 1.1 became a W3C Recommendation on May 31,
2001. The standard known as XHTML5 is being developed as an XML
adaptation of the HTML5 specification.</p>

<div id="Overview">
<h1 id="Overview_title">OVERVIEW</h1>

<p id="Overview_text">XHTML 1.0 is "a reformulation of the three HTML 4 document types as applications of XML 1.0".[3] The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) also continues to maintain the HTML 4.01 Recommendation, and the specifications for HTML5 and XHTML5 are being actively developed. In the current XHTML 1.0 Recommendation document, as published and revised to August 2002, the W3C commented that, "The XHTML family is the next step in the evolution of the Internet. By migrating to XHTML today, content developers can enter the XML world with all of its attendant benefits, while still remaining confident in their content's backward and future compatibility."[3]
However, in 2005, the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working
Group (WHATWG) formed, independently of the W3C, to work on advancing
ordinary HTML not based on XHTML. The WHATWG eventually began working
on a standard that supported both XML and non-XML serializations,
HTML5, in parallel to W3C standards such as XHTML 2. In 2007, the
W3C's HTML working group voted to officially recognize HTML5 and work
on it as the next-generated HTML standard.[4] In 2009, the W3C allowed
the XHTML 2 Working Group's charter to expire, acknowledging that
HTML5 would be the sole next-generation HTML standard, including both
XML and non-XML serializations.[5]</p>

<div id="Motivation">
<h1>MOTIVATION</h1>

<p>XHTML was developed to make HTML more extensible and increase
interoperability with other data formats.[7] HTML 4 was ostensibly an
application of Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML); however
the specification for SGML was complex, and neither web browsers nor
the HTML 4 Recommendation were fully conformant to it.[8] The XML
standard, approved in 1998, provided a simpler data format closer in
simplicity to HTML 4.[9] By shifting to an XML format, it was hoped
HTML would become compatible with common XML tools;[10] servers and
proxies would be able to transform content, as necessary, for
constrained devices such as mobile phones.[11] By using namespaces,
XHTML documents could provide extensibility by including fragments
from other XML-based languages such as Scalable Vector Graphics and
MathML.[12] Finally, the renewed work would provide an opportunity to
divide HTML into reusable components (XHTML Modularization) and clean
up untidy parts of the language.[13]</p>

<h1>ADOPTION</h1>

<a name="adoption">The similarities between HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0 led many web sites and content management systems to adopt the initial W3C XHTML 1.0 Recommendation. To aid authors in the transition, the W3C provided guidance on how to publish XHTML 1.0 documents in an HTML-compatible manner, and serve them to browsers that were not designed for XHTML.[18][19]
Such "HTML-compatible" content is sent using the HTML media type (text/html) rather than the official Internet media type for XHTML (application/xhtml+xml). When measuring the adoption of XHTML to that of regular HTML, therefore, it is important to distinguish whether it is media type usage or actual document contents that is being compared.
Most web browsers have mature support[20] for all of the possible XHTML media types.[21] The notable exception is Internet Explorer versions 8 and earlier by Microsoft; rather than rendering application/xhtml+xml content, a dialog box invites the user to save the content to disk instead. Both Internet Explorer 7 (released in 2006) and Internet Explorer 8 (released in March 2009) exhibit this behavior.[22] Microsoft developer Chris Wilson explained in 2005 that IE7’s priorities were improved browser security and CSS support, and that proper XHTML support would be difficult to graft onto IE’s compatibility-oriented HTML parser;[23] however, Microsoft added support for true XHTML in IE9.[24]
As long as support is not widespread, most web developers avoid using
XHTML that is not HTML-compatible,[25] so advantages of XML such as
namespaces, faster parsing and smaller-footprint browsers do not
benefit the user.</a>
